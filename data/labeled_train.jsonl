{"text": "Noobie question: Data storage demands for OPC UA data?\n\nHey y'all, I hope this is the right place to ask such a question: I work in a production research institute and we are currently ordering production devices that will output sensor data via OPC UA. The companies building the machines are hard to pin down when it comes to estimates about the storage requirements, and we need to order the respective servers soon due to grant deadines etc. So I am trying to estimate what a good baseline of storage could look like with the OPC UA format, and maybe someone can me point me into the right direction or at least towards the right questions. A few basic points: \\- The machines will run intermittently, not 24/7. \\- We have a few dozen to a few hundred sensors depending on the machine, all of them outputting time series data with a sample once every \\~10 to 100ms \\- On the first edge computer (one fore each machine), we do not want to store the data longer than a month and migrate it for more long term storage somewhere else \\- The current pipeline looks like this: PLC -- Telegraf -- InfluxDB/ TimescaleDB I would prefer some kind of scada or data historian solution, but this is not planned in the budget I was given. What would a basic computer have to look like to reliably receive and store this kind of data? Thank you in advance, any input is appreciated!", "label": "complex"}

When playing anything I first get a crackling, and then the esp resets. Before there was crackling before the audio and then again after wherever was played. No audio at all now, just reset. Also before I could drive both legs at the same time, now only one is spinning at a time. What could cause this? I did make some actual smoke my accidentally hooking up 9V that was supposed to power up the motors, to VIN, but the ESP has voltage regulators, right?

{"text": "Using a single STM32 pin for ADC and digital input through a PGA — possible?\n\nHello I’m learning to design a PCB for my Formula Student team. We have multiple sensors that operate at **5 V**, but our **STM32 analog inputs are not 5 V tolerant (STM32 analog input is capped at 3.3V)**. To safely read these sensors and have flexibility, I’m considering using a **programmable gain amplifier (PGA)** in front of the MCU. Ideally, this PGA would let me **amplify or attenuate** the input signals so they stay within 0–3.3 V, depending on the sensor and my measurement needs. Here’s my main question: * Is it possible to use the **same MCU pin** for both **analog measurements (ADC)** and **digital input** (like reading a button or switch)? * The idea is that the PGA could be set to unity gain (×1) when using the pin as digital, so the voltage would pass unchanged, and I could enable a pull-up on the MCU for digital mode. * I want to avoid dedicating separate pins for analog and digital signals if possible, to **reduce the total number of connectors** on the PCB. The idea, which I am not sure if it is possible would be something like this: https://preview.redd.it/i8jia3oztskf1.png?width=559&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=25e3c18827ff074b8c7c266d5c746fcbddedd545 My idea, which might be completly wrong or stupid, is that if I set x1 gain to the PGA I will just send the input voltage unaltered to my mcu and I will be able to read it normaly as a digital signal.

The one thing I've still had trouble with is Bluetooth; throughout the day, my mouse and keyboard would randomly drop, then reconnect, then drop, and so on ad infinitum until a reboot. I found running the Bluetooth troubleshooter to be useless - or less than, as the Bluetooth radio often would refuse to turn back on afterward. I finally tracked down the cause - Windows has been disabling the Bluetooth Radio to \"save power\". Perhaps this would be useful while running on battery power, but it's a nuisance while plugged in and using peripherals. If you're on Windows 11 and also dealing with this, the fix is easy: 1. Open Device Manager 2. Expand the \"Bluetooth\" entry &amp; find your adapter (e.g. \"MediaTek Bluetooth Adapter\") 3.

Basically my plan was to use the signal from the esp32 to control a transistor that would directly control the coil. Sidenote: If anyone knows more abt this kind of super high frequency tesla coil I had one question, does the type signal that gets fed into the primary coil need to be a sine wave?

In general I would say it's good for the learning process. When I tried to do the same with interrupts I encountered some problems. All the sources I found where using CubeMX/Stm32Cube IDE. So I generated the code as the videos showed me and then tried to copy the parts which I thought being relevant into my code, but it didn't work. Can somebody explain me what to do to create interrupts and why certain steps are necessary/what they are doing?

I initially planned to use **I²C**, and I’m aware that the ESP32 supports **two separate I²C buses**, which I’m already using – one for communication and one for the display on each slave. Everything basically works, but it feels **unreliable, not clean**, and **not fast enough**. Especially with multiple devices on the bus, things tend to get messy. Is there a **better and more robust solution** than I²C for wired ESP32-to-ESP32 communication in a master-slave setup? If so, what would you recommend?", "label": "complex"}

{"text": "Time synchronisation in multiple sensor for sensor fusion\n\nTitle: How is time synchronization handled across multiple sensors in sensor fusion? Body: I’m trying to understand how time synchronization is achieved when fusing data from multiple sensors. From what I gather, there are two main challenges: Each sensor’s data packet is usually timestamped relative to its own internal MCU clock. When these packets arrive at a central processor, how are they all converted into the same time reference? Once everything is aligned to a common reference, only then can techniques like buffering IMU data (to interpolate/extrapolate and match with incoming sensor data) be applied effectively. For example, in my setup I have a radar and an IMU, both connected separately via USB (two different ports) to a central PC for processing. Since they don’t share a hardware clock, I’m not sure how to properly align their data streams. So how is this typically done in practice? Do systems distribute a common clock to all sensors? Or is it usually handled by timestamp correction at the fusion stage? How do real-world implementations (e.g., robotics, UAVs, automotive) achieve robust temporal alignment? Any explanation, references, or examples of common approaches would be really helpful.", "label": "complex"}

I am using a double buffer and would like to process the data in one half of a buffer while the other half is being filled. Currently, my processing function is simply looking for a peak value. Unfortunately, my processing function can't process the buffer fast enough to keep up with the ADC as shown in the first scope image (purple is buffer reaching half full, blue is time spent in processData() function). When I remove the the lines from the processing function that grab the buffer value and compare it to the previous max, the processing function can keep up (second scope image).

The tricky part is that I need to update the firmware remotely, as the devices will be deployed in the field and access will be limited. I’ve been looking into remote access tools like FlexiHub to connect to the STM32 and push updates remotely, but I’m not sure how well it would work in this case or if there’s a better solution for handling remote firmware updates. Some specific questions I have: Best practices for setting up OTA updates on STM32, especially with remote access involved. Should I be using SPI flash or internal flash for OTA storage? Any libraries or tools recommended for secure and efficient OTA updates? How to handle partial or interrupted updates reliably? Has anyone done something similar or tried using FlexiHub (or similar tools) for remote STM32 access during OTA updates? Any advice or experiences would be greatly appreciated!", "label": "complex"}

The OLED does not turn on even though I am using a predefined software library for the SPI communication. Does this solder look fine? I held the soldering iron on the board for what I felt was too long, used 350°C, and used lead-free solder. Although I don’t see too bad of burn marks, could burning cause nothing to work? In the third picture, it seems the header pins are not fully attached. Is there a commonly used way to hold the pins while soldering? Is this gap a problem in general? Would a multimeter continuity test on the soldered part and the pin passing mean anything? I tried this and it worked, but in my mind, a continuity test like this does not prove much.

My teammates and I are currently working on our final project, and one of the main tasks is to establish communication between an Arduino Mega 2560 and a PLC (either Allen-Bradley or Omron). The reason we’re using both is that we were asked to use both Arduino and PLC in this final project by college. Here's what we're aiming for: * The Arduino reads data from soil sensors. * Based on this data, it makes decisions and sends a boolean array to the PLC. * The PLC then turns pumps on or off accordingly. Our tutor mentioned that this could be done using relays, but we’re not entirely sure how to implement that setup in detail. I also asked AI, and it suggested using an Ethernet module (like the W5500 with RJ45) for network communication between the Arduino and the PLC. # My questions are: 1. What is the most practical and reliable method to achieve this simple communication between Arduino and a PLC? 2. **Is communication between MCUs like Arduino or STM32 and PLCs common in real-world industrial applications?** The reason I’m asking is that I’m also trying to boost my resume. If this kind of communication is relevant in the industry, I’d like to try both ways, and I will try my ESP 8266 to do a wireless communication with a PLC.

{"text": "[Project Demo] Secure MQTT over SSL/TLS (MQTTS) on ESP32 + 4G LTE Air Monitor\n\nHi everyone, Just wanted to share a recent update from our team as we’ve been working with MQTT for a while on various IoT projects (ESP32-based smart displays, soil sensors, air quality monitors, etc.). We recently upgraded one of our LTE-based air quality monitors to support **MQTTS (MQTT over SSL/TLS)** to enhance data security in real-world applications — especially for agricultural and environmental deployments where cellular is involved. 🔒 Why MQTTS? We needed a secure channel to transmit sensor data over public networks. MQTT is great for lightweight communication, but adding SSL/TLS (i.e., MQTTS) was a must for encrypted transmission and device authentication. Here’s what i did: * Used an ESP32 with 4G LTE module * Implemented TLS handshake using CA certs * Switched broker setup to support SSL * Verified compatibility with cloud platforms (we used a Mosquitto broker for testing) Full working demo and setup here (open source): [https://wiki.makerfabs.com/4G%20LTE%20Air%20Monitor.html#6-mqtts-demo](https://wiki.makerfabs.com/4G%20LTE%20Air%20Monitor.html#6-mqtts-demo) Also, for context, this builds on one of our earlier MQTT UI-sync demos using touch-screen ESP32S3 boards: [https://www.instructables.com/MaTouchESP32S3-SPI-TFT-with-AI-28-ST7789V-MQTT-App/](https://www.instructables.com/MaTouchESP32S3-SPI-TFT-with-AI-28-ST7789V-MQTT-App/) Would love to hear how others are handling MQTT security in the field.

The issue I’m encountering is that the ESP32 either **restarts** or **loses its network connection** whenever the contactor is switched on or off. # Project Setup: * **ESP32** controlling a 12V contactor via a **transistor-based driver circuit** using the **ULN2003A IC**. * **W5500 Ethernet module** for network communication. * Powering the ESP32 and W5500 from a **5V buck converter** that steps down from a **12V SMPS**, which also powers the 12V contactor. * The **ULN2003A** has built-in **flyback diodes** for inductive load protection. * I’ve added **2 x 470µF capacitors** and **2 x 100nF capacitors** to stabilize the power supply for the ULN2003A. # The Problem: Whenever the **12V contactor switches** (on or off), the **ESP32 restarts** or **loses its network connection**.

While debugging a new Frigate NVR instance running (not related to my old NVR and on the LAN part of the network), the people helping me in the HA forum suggested had a network problem likely causing Frigate's ffmpeg service to crash talking to the camera. I noticed if I pinged the cameras from my LAN, I'd get a redirect message from ping, I initially didn't think this was an issue as it \"seemed\" to work ok as vlc streamed fine, HA was streaming cameras to the UI fine, etc. However to debug Frigate NVR, I moved the cameras over to a dedicated interface plumbed through my firewall, and eliminated the manual route set up on the Ubuntu NVR system.

Basically, I am trying to measure the wheel speed of a formula student car. The wheel hubs have magnets glued on them(the holes are made with a cnc machine so they are almost pefect) and an off-axis hall sensor(digital) is placed and whenever a magnet passes in front of it it sends a logic '1'(3.3 V) and a logic '0'(0V) when no magnet is in front of it.I use the input capture mode of an STM32(stm32f103c8t6) in order to measure the time between two rising edges. However, even though I get the correct waveform, the measurments are inaccurate and they seem noisy.I checked with an oscilloscope and the output of the sensor was a regular square wave(there was some ringing but nothing out of the ordinary). Below are some graphs of the measured outputs and the code I used. The first graph is the rpm which are measured by a resolver(mounted on the motor)and the motor controller. They seem to have been passed through an FIR filter since the graph has a slight delay. edit: 32 magnets are used, and after I calculate the frequency I divide it with 32. edit2: rl\\_hall = real left wheel hall sensor, rr\\_hall = rear right wheel hall sensor [Hall Effect Sensor](https://m.littelfuse.com/~/media/electronics/datasheets/hall_effect_sensors/littelfuse_hall_effect_sensors_55075_d", "label": "complex"}

The sensors are connected to the ESP32 via radio (not Bluetooth), but for all practical purposes they could have been I2C or SPI or any other communication protocol. In our code, we have a struct that represents a sensor, and a list of struct instances, each instance being a different se sir. These sensors send an id number, battery level, and some data in the form of a float. This is the data contained in those structs. There will be at least one sensor, but there may be any number of sensors. I've come to the following options: 1. Create a single sensor service, with a characteristic for ID, characteristic for battery level, characteristic for sensor value. All three are readable. We may have to include a writable characteristic to request data from a particular sensor, although we may be able to make the ID characteristic both readable and writable. 1 service, 3 characteristics. The Android phone requests sensor data from a particular sensor by writing the sensor ID to the ESP32, then reads the ID, battery level, and sensor data characteristics. Repeat this write and read process for each sensor. 2. Create multiple services that each contain a sensor ID, battery level, and sensor data characteristics, similar to what we've described above.

{"text": "SPI Interference Issue between ST7789 Display and SD Card on Arduino\n\nHi everyone, I'm running into a strange issue with my Arduino project where I'm using both an SD card and an ST7789 display on the same SPI bus. Here's how my pins are set up: \\- Pin 13 (SCL): SPI Clock \\- Pin 12 (MISO): SPI Master In \\- Pin 11 (MOSI): SPI Master Out \\- Pin 8 (SD\\_CS): Chip Select for the SD card \\- Pin 7 (TFT\\_CS): Chip Select for the display \\- Pin 3 (TFT\\_DC): Data/Command for the display \\- Pin 2 (TFT\\_RST): Reset for the display The problem: When the display is connected, the SD card fails to initialize (SD.begin() returns false). When I physically disconnect the display, the SD card initializes correctly. What I've tried so far: Initializing the display first and then setting its CS pin high before initializing the SD card. Confirming that my SPI connections are correct and that the bus (MOSI, MISO, SCL) is shared between both devices. Added an explicit SPI.begin() call and verified power and logic levels. It seems that even with the display's CS pin set high, the display module might still be interfering on the SPI bus. Has anyone encountered a similar issue or have suggestions on how to isolate the display from the SD card during SPI communication?

Hopefully I made a mistake researching this, but if not, then the atmega will not be able to emulate a keyboard, correct? However, at least the `mega2560` should be capable of doing this. So I installed the `Keyboard` library and wrote some code. It did not work, so I figured, due to me being a beginner, I made some mistakes. I loaded a Keyboard example instead, but not even that works. It keeps asking me if I included `#include &lt;Keyboard.h&gt;` in my `.ino` file. Yes, I have. The library is installed. I included it. But it seems to never find it! I then tried using a `digispark USB` board with the `DigiKeyboardMultilang` library; while this works, I have no further experience with the digispark board and would prefer to use a regular arduino to learn more about the workflow. Does anybody understand, why the library will not be loaded, even though I tried including it into my sketch? I tried `#include &lt;Keyboard.h&gt;`, but also `#include &lt;(full-path-to-Keyboard-folder)/Keyboard.h&gt;` and `#include lib/Keyboard.h` (copying the `lib` folder and pasting it into the project folder). It will not work in either of those cases, always missing the library. I made sure to run the latest version of Arduino IDE. OS is archlinux, also everything updated.

In my opinion, it is more reliable than Ethernet—it’s only a portion of twisted copper wire, and no additional infrastructure (switches, routers, etc.) is needed. Unfortunately, CAN has one flaw (that can be seen as an advantage in other circumstances): it only allows 8 bytes of data per single frame. I would like to use AT commands, so I need to send and receive ASCII strings, usually larger than 8 bytes. In other words, I need some kind of transport layer that handles communication between nodes, slicing messages into many frames and merging them together on the other side of the cable. I found a description of the ISO 15765-2 protocol (also known as ISO-TP). It looks quite interesting, but I do not feel up to the task of implementing it myself. I found one C library: GitHub - openxc/isotp-c: An implementation of the ISO-TP (ISO15765-2) CAN protocol in C. Unfortunately, the description leaves no doubt: this version does not yet support multi-frame messages. Is there any hope for sending messages longer than 8 bytes?

{"text": "[HELP] Power Issues with ESP32 and WS2812B Strip (823 LEDs)\n\nHello, I have the following problem. I don't have very deep knowledge about LEDs or WLED, but I'm quite happy with what WLED provides so far :) I'm using a BTF SK6812 RGBNW LED strip in one of my projects as additional lighting. The strip has 762 LEDs. It's powered by a 5V 60A 300W power supply and works perfectly. So I get for my living room, too. There I’m using a BTF WS2812B RGB strip with more LEDs - 823 in total, approximately 14.5 meters long. By mistake, I initially used the same 5V 60A 300W power supply, but it wasn’t sufficient. I replaced it with a 5V 80A 400W power supply, but the issue I expected to resolve still persists. The strip is powered every 3 meters with a separate power cable. It also has a microphone (INMP441) connected to the ESP32. When I turn on the strip at higher brightness levels - especially with certain colors - it blinks once, and at that moment, the ESP32 crashes and restarts. However, when I power the ESP32 separately using a portable battery, the problem doesn’t occur. I don’t have any issues controlling the full strip at lower brightness levels. Currently, the ESP32 is powered from the strip’s connector. I’ve noticed that most colors cause this problem when brightness goes above 140–150. White (which I know draws the most power) triggers the issue even at just 60–70 brightness. What can you recommend to avoid or fix this issue?", "label": "complex"}

{"text": "Random Wifi + IP stack problem\n\nHi, I'm developing a product in which we use ESP32 with ESP-IDF v4.1.1. Since an undefined period of time, multiple of our products started disconnecting from our client's Wifi. They stay in this state until a reboot is performed. The time until the fatal disconnection is random and there is no single event that could be linked to it. What I noticed over hours of testing: * There is plenty of RAM left (\\~60K) * A reboot cures the issue * Some time before I took over the project, wifi power-saving was introduced * The problem seems to happen the most when the ESP32 are connected to Ubiquiti appliances I tried logging the problem multiple times but the only things that are displayed are : wifi:m f null wifi:bcn_timout,ap_probe_send_start Unfortunately these error codes are not very talkative. The first one is usually used to demonstrate a memory allocation failure with the type of failure and wanted memory size and the second indicates that the ESP32 has not received the access point beacon for some time and will actively try to contact the AP five times. Normally, after the second event is fired the WIFI stack is \"rebooted\" and everything gets in order however in my case, nothing is happening. I'm completely out of ideas and I don't know what to do to debug this issue. I cannot reproduce it at will which is what makes difficult to debug.

{"text": "Interrupts making receiving IR signals unreliable - advice please\n\nHi, I’m working on an LED strip that is capable of responding to an IR signal and I know that theoretically the IR receiver would be more robust with interrupts, but when I try to use them, the signal received from the IR code becomes very unreliable. Can anyone advise what's up? In brief, I have an Arduino Nano and a 5V 4-pin (non-individually addressable +GRB) strip. It’s just a bit of decoration inside a cabinet. It's all powered by a USB plugged into the back of an Xbox. The idea is the strip comes on when the Xbox is in use but because the Xbox USBs are always powered, I’ve set the console up to send an IR signal to toggle the lights when it's turned on/off. I’ve uploaded the sketch to GitHub here: [https://github.com/Simontheintrepid22/CabinetLEDStrip/blob/main/CabinetLEDwithInterrupts](https://github.com/Simontheintrepid22/CabinetLEDStrip/blob/main/CabinetLEDwithInterrupts) The IR receiver is set to pin 2. The interrupt code on lines 28 and 38–46 saves the incoming signal to a variable, named IRinput. This is then used in the main loop, which recognises the power signal (869042040) to turn the LEDs on/off, after which, IRinput is reset to 0 (lines 54–64). What’s strange is that although inconsistent, the IR receiver seems to be registering other buttons as 869042040, but only once, after which it seems to be able to recognise them correctly. It also seems to be reading the correct power signal as other codes and ignoring it. The code is not especially complex and works", "label": "complex"}

{"text": "Do you know about the stability of internal clock sources on STM32 MCUs?\n\nI know that the accuracy of internal clock sources is not great (vs external crystal). However, I sort of expected the clock frequency to be fairly stable (maybe with some drift over time). However, I have a GPS module 1PPS signal connected to the an STM32F4 NUCLEO board, and reading timer counter values on the 1PPS edge shows more variance than I would expect (not a lot, but more than expected). So either the 1PPS signal is not very stable (I doubt that) or the timer clock frequencies are not very stable and have short-term variance. The variance is low enough that it probably wouldn't bother most applications. Any experience in this? BTW my NUCELO has a place for crystal, but it isn't populated. It does have a crystal for the RTC, but I can't get high resolution timing from the RTC. EDIT: Thanks to all who responded. As background, I am trying to do some measurements of the jitter in OS scheduling response time to an interrupt (that interrupt being the GPS 1PPS). In preparation for that, I am starting with something much simpler. I just have a GPIO set up for interrupt (the 1PPS), and am reading a timer counter in the interrupt handler, and am looking at the timer counter delta between interrupts. I would have expected the delta to be a constant value, +/- 1. I would have been OK with slow drift of that delta value. I believe the GPIO interrupt to be the highest priority exception in the system. There isn't a lot of software involved, but I will look at that in more detail", "label": "complex"}

One question I have is, how do you select the clock frequency for your application? For example, I'm using an STM32F413 with a max clock frequency of 100MHz, but I know the programs I'm writing for it don't require the processor to be fast. Also, considering the power consumption by the controller to run programs that don't need such clock speeds, wouldn't it be better to use a lower clock frequency when writing basic programs? To be clear, I'm not talking about writing programs to learn, I mean selecting a clock frequency when working on a project. What are your experiences?", "label": "complex"}
{"text": "Erratic ST7789 TFT display weirdness\n\nHi folks, I'd love some hardware assistance if anyone can help! I'm using a small TFT display with a ST7789 controller (this one: [https://s.click.aliexpress.com/e/\\_om0jckF](https://s.click.aliexpress.com/e/_om0jckF) ), wired via SPI connection to an ESP32, in conjunction with Bodmer's TFT\\_eSPI library (here: [https://github.com/Bodmer/TFT\\_eSPI](https://github.com/Bodmer/TFT_eSPI) ). I'm using the default VSPI interface, together with BLK/CS/DC connections on GPIO pins 19/5/15 I've used this library successfully in several other projects with various controllers, so I think I'm reasonably proficient at understanding how to set the hardware and software up. However, I'm facing a frustrating issue with a certain display that only works for a second or so when I touch the cables, and then fades out again. I don't think it's a loose connection because it doesn't flicker when I jiggle the cables at all. And, if I hold my fingers on the cables after its faded, I can't get it to come on again. So I can't get any sort of consistant display at all - just for a few seconds each time I release and re-touch it. It's as if it's some sort of grounding/capacitance problem. The board itself seems well-made - I can't see any weak solder joints, misplaced components etc. Just wondered if anyone had used these same modules and encountered similar issues, or any suggestions what I could look for to debug?!

My main concern is how to get the data from the ADC into the MCU fast enough without losing samples. The idea is to use an external high-speed ADC, something around 8–12 bits with a sampling rate between 40 and 80 MSPS, to capture the 10.7 MHz signal. I want to feed this data into the STM32 and then do the digital down-mixing, low-pass filtering, and decimation in software, kind of like a small SDR setup. After that, I’d process the lower-rate baseband signal inside the MCU. I was thinking about using an STM32H743VIT6 because it’s pretty powerful for an MCU. It runs at 480 MHz, has DMA, and features a DCMI that supports parallel data and up to about 80 MHz pixel clock rates. What worries me is that if I use SPI to read the ADC, it’s obviously way too slow. So I’ve been considering using the DCMI interface instead to capture samples in parallel, since it can transfer data directly to RAM through DMA. But I don’t know if this is actually a good or reliable way to continuously stream ADC samples at tens of MSPS. So my question is basically: does it make sense to use the DCMI interface for this kind of application? Has anyone successfully connected a high-speed ADC to an STM32 for digital signal processing? Are there better ways to feed data at that rate into an STM?", "label": "complex"}

I have been using [pschatzmann](https://github.com/pschatzmann)'s library for Bluetooth and this has worked well. I am also using [Arduino-Audio-Tools](https://github.com/pschatzmann/arduino-audio-tools) for SD card playback but this has given me some trouble. Currently I have issues switching between these sources. That is, it starts in BT mode by default and I can switch between BT and SD without issue, but if a BT device is connected then it will crash upon switching. This crash is accompanied by malloc errors in console and a register dump. I am able to start in BT mode and play music, only switching between BT/SD after a BT device is connected causes the crash. The code uses a basic state machine with a playbackMode variable. This is setup so BT or SD will have an initialization stage before the main loop code runs. The stages are split up in if blocks like \"currentState == initBluetooth\" in handleBluetooth() and handleSDcard(). I think there is an issue with some of the BT variables not being deinitialized or reinitialized correctly but my experiments have not yielded much. I will include pastebin links to my source and error output. The code I linked is a simplified version and not very polished but includes all the same BT/SD parts.

I'm using the OBDII-UART Sparkfun adapter (datasheet [https://www.sparkfun.com/products/9555](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/9555)) with an Arduino Mega to collect the electronic informations of my car. As the datasheet says: The Sparkfun adapter 'provides you a serial interface using the ELM327 command set' between your arduino and the OBD2 port of your car. To do this, I am using the ELM327 library (GitHub - irvined1982/arduino-ELM327: ELM327 Library for Arduino). Other poeple used it before me with a Sparkfun Adapter (see OBD-II UART Speed - SparkFun Electronics). To begin my project, I uploaded a simple sketch on my Arduino Mega: #define ELM_TIMEOUT 9000 #define ELM_BAUD_RATE 9600 #define ELM_PORT Serial1 #include <ELM327.h> Elm327 Elm; void setup() { Serial.begin(9600); byte status; int temperature; status=Elm.begin(); if (status != ELM_SUCCESS){ Serial.print('Elm begin failed with error: ''); Serial.println(status); } status=Elm.coolantTemperature(temperature); if (status == ELM_SUCCESS){ Serial.print('Coolant Temperature: ''); Serial.println(temperature); } else { Serial.print('Elm begin failed with error: '); Serial.println(status); } } void loop() { // put your main code here, to run repeatedly: } Then I connected the Sparkfun Rx to my Arduino Mega Tx1, the Sparkfun Tx to my Arduino Mega Rx1 and Sparkfun ground to my Arduino Mega ground. Then, I opened the serial monitor (9600) and the result was: AT E0XXXXXXXXXAT SP 0XXXXXXXXXElm begin failed with error : 1 When you go to the .h file you can see that error 1 means: ELM no response. I do not understand why I have this error?", "label": "complex"}

I don't want to add buttons to it for boot selection, so I added a TagConnect footprint to allow me to enter DFU mode using the ESPProg board for the initial firmware upload. It was my understanding that after flashing the first firmware with USB CDC On Boot enabled, I could then flash future firmware using the USB port. Unfortunately, this doesn't seem to work. Even after flashing the first firmware successfully, the device doesn't appear at all on my mac. The ESPProg board appears fine, which is also ESP-based, so I don't think it is a driver issue. When connected via USB (whether in DFU mode or otherwise), it's not recognized as a device at all and doesn't appear in `lsusb`. This is the layout: https://imgur.com/LvmxYe3 * The TC header is top left, this connects to RX/TX and IO0/EN * Flashing via RX/TX works * Entering DFU mode via the buttons on the ESPProg works * The USB data pins go through and ESD diode straight to D+/D- on the ESP * Good continuity between the USB data pins and the ESP * Good power when connected via USB, stable 3.3v * I'm using ESP32-S3-WROOM-1-N4 * I'm following [these docs](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/arduino-esp32/en/latest/tutorials/cdc_dfu_flash.html) for enabling USB CDC Any ideas?", "label": "complex"}
{"text": "IR demodulation in software\n\nThis is probably really easy, but I haven't done stuff like this in a long time, and I'm having a bit of a brain fart. For those not familiar, IR remote controls usually use on-off keying (OOK) with a \\~38kHz carrier signal. So to send a one, the carrier is sent, and to send a zero, nothing is sent. So the receiver needs to basically detect the presence of the carrier while rejecting background IR noise at different frequencies including DC (usually IR interference is at a much lower frequency - eg. from the sun). Usually a circuit is used to demodulate this in hardware, but it feels simple enough that I should be able to do it in software and it would be a fun exercise (using an STM32F7, so I have an ADC that can sample much faster than Nyquist, as well as a 216 MHz ARM CPU with FPU). I can do it with FFT (what kind of window size would make sense?), but it seems like there should be an easier way since I don't actually need to whole spectrum? Thanks", "label": "complex"}

{"text": "Have you ever used secure OPC UA over the internet? What was your experience like?\n\nHey folks, I’ve been exploring secure OPC UA connectivity over the internet and came across [this article from the OPC Foundation](https://opcconnect.opcfoundation.org/2017/04/secure-opc-ua-connectivity/). It dives into how OPC UA was designed with security in mind from the ground up—encryption, authentication, and integrity checks are all built into the protocol. The article also discusses how OPC UA can be securely deployed across firewalls and public networks using standard IT security practices like TLS, certificates, and reverse proxies. It’s pretty compelling, especially for those of us working in industrial automation or OT environments where secure remote access is becoming more critical. I’m curious—has anyone here actually implemented secure OPC UA over the internet in a production setting? How did it go? Any lessons learned, performance issues, or unexpected challenges?

When measuring the hall sensor output voltage while the motor is engaged (but not turning—the hall state is not changing between 0 and 1, it is constantly at 1), the waveform looks like this. I also tried it with capacitors in the 1–10 nF range between +5 V and GND and between hall output and GND, but it had no effect on the waveform.

I have two devices on my home network (FIOS -&gt; EERO Pro -&gt; Switch -&gt; Device1, device 2 is wifi connected to EERO Pro). They are communicating with UDP packets. If I have them set to send them to each other (destination address is specific), 100% of messages are delivered (close to) 100% of the time. Certainly as good as one would expect with an unconfirmed protocol. If I switch the replies to be broadcast messages (as one does if multiple clients need to hear the replies), probably 10% of them get dropped. They all take longer to arrive (1/2 second or more). It gets worse if they come out in clusters, but those clusters are okay if they are being sent as directed messages. Any ideas if this is just the way it is or if there is a setting somewhere/somehow that I can change to improve this?

{"text": "I have an old piece of instrument that is supposed to connect with a Windows XP machine. I keep getting 'Framing Error' messages on the instrument panel while the PC side shows that the instrument could not be found. The instrument uses RS232C in a 9-pin serial port to connect to the PC. If I understand correctly, RS232C is the same as the prevailing RS232 on Windows XP. I have tested the serial port on the XP machine with Hyper Terminal and made sure I use the proper 'straight-through' type of cable. The cable has been used in the same location with other instruments and worked properly. In order to connect the instrument with an XP machine, I have set the following parameters to be the same on both sides: Baud rate 9600, Data Bits 8, Parity None, Stop Bits 1, Handshake None. However, on the instrument side, there is an item called 'terminator' with CR, LF, and CR+LF settings, which is not available on the serial port settings for Windows XP. I tried all three settings, but none worked. What should I do next? Edit: According to the service manual: An RS232C format serial port is available at the DE-9 connector J3. U8 provides voltage level translation from +5 volts and ground to ±12 volts. Direct I/O control lines are used for all signals because of the timing-critical nature of the communications protocol.

I am creating a MIDI controller with potentiometers and there is no room for error on something like that. What I do is: Start the ADC in continuous conversion mode (10 bit) via DMA and save the value to a variable continuously and use live expressions to read the variable. The problem: The value instead of staying constant when not moving the potentiometer, without even touching it it goes about +/- 15 from where it should be. If for example, it should be reading 500, it read from 485 to 515 continuously ([here is a video about it](https://youtu.be/9_LHo8zOmLI). please watch the whole video). I've got the NUCLEO-F439ZI board with a regular 10k Potentiometer What I have tried so far: 1. Changing cables 2. Changing potentiometer (I have also tried several valued potentiometers but the motorized faders that I will be using on the final creation are 10kOhm) 3. Eliminating every EMI/EMF interference by taking the board somewhere with no electric/electronic devices. (Although this should not be a problem because I do not have any device emitting EMI on my room) 4. De-soldering SB12 from the NUCLEO board and used external VREF from voltage regulator AND computer PSU (not at the same time of course) but the problem persisted on both cases. 5.

The issue is that when I test the communication between the two boards, I don’t receive anything. However, when I perform loopback tests separately on the FPGA and on the STM32, both work fine.

{"text": "Is there a way to configure the WiFi module on the ESP32 to work as a pure RF transciever?\n\nI am looking into making a high throughput, medium range (50m), low latency data transmission between multiple ESP32's. The environment where the system would work is packed with noisy (in the RF sense) interference generators like lamps, lighting, sound systems and walls. The idea is to **have one of them as a broadcaster and others listeners for the broadcasted messages**. In some sense, it's a simplex communication so we don't need to have any ACK's from the receiver(s) end. Additionally, I've already tried this with UDP broadcast in soft AP mode, and, though it works it's HORRID in the power consumption sense. The main culprit being the TX of the broadcaster. **I want something low power** so I can power the devices using batteries and achieve the TX and RX working upwards of 12h before charging on a 3.7LiPo or Li-Ion battery. So I've ditched the way of WiFi and am ready for a pure RF solution without any TCP/IP overhead and heating. Since in essence the WiFi module IS an RF module, I got the idea, can I actually just have it broadcast the digital data through the air on some carrier frequency and other ESP32's constantly listening on that carrier and receiving the data and forwarding it further for processing? For the end, I'm looking to have speeds at the **very least** 282KBps or 2250Kbps (\\~2.2Mbps). This is a simplex comm so this is one way throughput. I am also looking to have **at most** 4ms transmission latency for the 50m distance. In the future, it would be nice", "label": "complex"}

{"text": "programming languages besides the standard industrial languages?\n\nBy standard industrial languages I mean the IEC 61131-3 languages. Ladder, function blocks and so on. I am pretty decent at ladder. I've taken classes where wiring the machine itself used ladder diagrams and then took a class where programming the machine used ladder logic. I've been told ladder logic is old school and archaic. That it will be replaced by \"real\" programming languages so only the l33t hackers of the world will be able to program a machine and maintenance be damned if they aren't also full time software engineers! Personally in my career I want to be a maintenance technician, or a controls technician, I'm also into computers though and have experience with computer networking (studying for CCNA) and am working on a degree in IT. Wouldn't mind being a programmer either. I already have a 2 year technical degree in industrial maintenance technology and that's where I learned ladder. They had different PLC classes but I chose the one focused on ladder because well I've wired up machines using ladder diagrams anyway so I figured it'd be more familiar. I'm really curious on what programming languages could be useful in the automation world besides the industrial languages that are used. I've programmed arduinos and the like before.

LCD freezes on the last displayed value, no serial prints, and no response to sensor changes. * Before freezing, I often notice **sensor readings start fluctuating wildly**, even though real-world values are stable. * I’ve tried isolating parts of the code and hardware — it seems the issue happens more often when both the HX711 and LCD are running together. **Things I’ve already checked:** * **Power supply** is stable (I even tried a bench PSU and USB power — same result). * Added **100nF caps** across analog sensor inputs to reduce noise — slight improvement, but freeze still happens. * Tried **different I2C addresses** and pull-up resistors for the LCD — no change. * HX711 and LCD work fine **individually** with simple example codes. * No **obvious memory leak** (used `FreeMemory()` library to check RA", "label": "complex"}

I've setup my awg to output a differential signal, a sine wave, 100mV peak to peak, 20 MHz, 50 ohm source load, scope is set to 50 ohm termination, balun is 50 ohm 1:1. The differential signal comes out of two channels from the awg, so essentially I have two coax cables carrying two sine waves that are 180 degrees out of phase. I verified this is the case in the scope. Waves were 100 mV peak to peak, 20 MHz, one out of phase from the other. I want to use the balun to convert the signal from differential to single ended. My expectation is that the single ended output from the balun will be a sine wave close to 200 mV peak to peak. At this frequency the balun is supposed to have about 0,2dB insertion loss. I've checked on the scope connected straight to the two outputs of the awg and when I do the math function taking the difference of one and the other I do get a 200mV peak to peak sine wave. However when I connect the differential signals to the balun, at the output I measure a 63.7 mV peak amplitude, instead of the 100 mV peak amplitude I was expecting from the D2S conversion.

I figured we'd start with data logging onto the SD card. Before that we should get the data from the sensors to pass correctly to our microcontroller. Our team is all pretty well-versed in Arduino, and I found that it is possible to make the STM32 read code from the Arduino IDE, which could be useful. I also think it may be buggy since we tried a few times and weren't too successful. My question is: How would taking the data from the sensors to pass to the microcontroller best be done for STM32 beginners? * Try to use the Arduino IDE? * Learn to use STM32 Programmer/IDE? (Will need a good source/tutorial to learn from/example to follow) * A different option? We are using an STM32F411CEU6 (Black Pill Development Board). We have working code for getting each of our 4 sensors to display on the Arduino Serial Monitor. We'd like to do the equivalent of displaying on the serial monitor to see that the data passes to the STM32 properly.

Has anyone set up remote access for an ST-Link? Would something like a Raspberry Pi as a bridge work, or are there better solutions? I’ve heard of using SSH or VPN, but I’m not sure about latency and reliability.", "label": "complex"}

{"text": "Issues with MQTT Relay\n\nSo, here's the setup. I have the Heltek Tracker nodes, and another local has the V3 nodes. we are too far apart with current infrastructure to communicate over the mesh at this point, but are working on fixing that. In the meantime we are trying to get a MQTT setup so we can still communicate over the nodes to get around flaky cellular networks. Now for the issue. My tracker nodes have been setup with MQTT to link up to homeassistant and have had no issues with that. But now that we are trying to setup a MQTT relay, it appears everything on my end is working, as I can send messages from either of my tracker nodes, and his V3 nodes are able to receive them. However, when he tries to send a message back, I am only able to receive things sent directly from his gateway node. Looking at MQTT Explorer, I am not even getting the traffic from his other node, while all other traffic does show up. I am using Mosquitto as the MQTT broker, both gateway nodes have the same private channel 2, which is what we are trying to relay, all nodes have Uplink and Downlink enabled on this channel, and all nodes are setup to allow MQTT relay. The only thing we can think of doing is having all of his nodes connected over mqtt as gateways, as enabling a network connection and MQTT on his other node allows it to communicate with my nodes over MQTT then RF, but none of his other nodes can transmit back to my nodes through either of his gateway nodes.", "label": "complex"}

{"text": "PSA: Avoid using the AMS1117 LDO for ESP32 Projects\n\nIf you’re designing a board with an ESP32 (or any low-voltage logic), **stop using the AMS1117 LDO**. Here’s why, and what you should use instead. # The Problems with the AMS1117 I recent project that I reviewed highlighted critical flaws in the AMS1117, especially for USB-powered or high-input-voltage projects: 1. **High Dropout Voltage Causes Instability** * The AMS1117 only specifies a min 1.0V dropout (Vin must be *at least* Vout + 1.0V). But in practice I have seen them have &gt;1.5V at only 0.3A (WiFi packets can easily cause this on the esp32). With long or low-quality USB cables the 5V from USB can easily drop to 4.5V and at that point the AMS1117 can cause the output 3.3V to drop below 3V and cause instability, brownouts, shutdowns or even cause the the chip to lockup until it is fully reset. 2. **Thermal Nightmares at high input voltages** * At 12V→3.3V, it dissipates **\\~8.7V \\* I\\_load**. Even at 200mA, that’s **1.7W** – enough to fry the SOT-223 package without a significant heatsink. 3. **Stability Issues with ceramic capacitors** * Datasheet requires specific output capacitors (e.g., 22µF tantalum) with precise ESR. Modern MLCCs (low ESR) can cause oscillation, leading to overvoltage or erratic behavior. # What to Use Instead **Switch to modern LDOs or buck converters:** * **XC6220** (or similar): * Dropout voltage is **60mV@0.3A** (vs. \\~1.5V!). * Stable with tiny MLCCs (10µF+), no ESR headaches. * Ideal for USB-powered projects where 5V→3.3V is common. * **AP", "label": "complex"}

The ADC calibration process is being run at boot as per the datasheet. I’m using 12-bit resolution and sampling for 13.5 cycles. The results are the same if I sample for longer (e.g. 239.5 cycles). Is this expected? I understand that the ADC is non-linear to some extent and that the error is dependent on where in the capacitor ladder the voltage is. Is this what I’m seeing here? Or is the 1 nF capacitor interfering in some way? I added it to reduce the induced noise on the power rail when the ADC was active. The datasheet says N/A for the impedance when using 239.5 cycles but I suspect 3 MΩ is still too much. One thing I’m considering is using a really large capacitor, 1 µF, and just sampling the voltage very occasionally.", "label": "complex"}

{"text": "Prevent Accidental Programming of ESP32\n\nI recently built a sort of control panel for my PC based on an ESP32 Devkit w/ a ESP32-WROOM-32 chip (specifically, one of these https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0D8T53CQ5). It communicates with the PC over the serial connection and stays connected pretty much permanently. I have, twice now, accidentally re-programmed it with code intended for another device because a reboot resulted in the ports getting shuffled around. I would like to prevent that specific ESP32 from being programmed. I've looked briefly into the secure boot functionality, but I think there's a decent chance I'll want to change things later, so I don't want to do anything permanent. In a perfect world, I would love if the device required holding down the BOOT button (or BOOT/EN buttons in some combination) to program. But I haven't been able to find any way to accomplish that. I wasn't able to find a good datasheet for this specific devkit, but from what documentation I could find (https://www.circuitstate.com/tutorials/getting-started-with-espressif-esp32-wifi-bluetooth-soc-using-doit-esp32-devkit-v1-development-board/) my understanding is that I may be able to disable the bootloader by pulling GPIO0 high.

I'm working on a project with an ESP32-S3 and a MAX98357 I2S amplifier (hooked up to a 4ohm 3W speaker) the goal is to stream audio from an API I've built, which serves raw PCM data. My problem: When playing audio streamed from the API, I hear persistent static or a \"sandy\" noise. Interestingly, if I generate a test tone locally on the ESP32, the audio is clear and static-free. This suggests to me that the basic I2S hardware and the function are working correctly, and the issue might lie in how the PCM data stream from the API is handled or some subtlety in the I2S configuration for continuous streaming, I test in my laptop and play the sound without noise **API** My API is built with NestJS, uses `ffmpeg` to convert audio files (in my case a .mp3) into a raw PCM data stream with the following specifications: * Audio Codec: `pcm_s16le` * Audio Channels: 1 (mono). * Sample Rate: 16000 Hz. * Stream Format: `s16le` The service reads a local audio file, converts it on-the-fly using `ffmpeg`, and streams the resulting PCM data. Here are the key parts of my `audio.cpp` file: https://pastebin.com/N87LKymk # Attempts Made: * Adjusting `dma_buf_count` and `dma_buf_len`. * Varying the `ringBuffer` size and prefill amount. * Ensuring `SAMPLE\\_RATE` and `bits_per_sample` match between the API and ESP32. * Trying both `I2S_CHANNEL_FMT_ONLY_LEFT` and `I2S_CHANNEL_FMT_ONLY_RIGHT`. * Checking physical connections to the MAX98357.

{"text": "Best practices for handling UDP fragmentation on microcontrollers\n\nI’m experimenting with UDP communication on a bare-metal microcontroller using **lwIP**. Since UDP packets can exceed the MTU and cause fragmentation, I’m looking into ways to avoid issues like dropped packets, reassembly overhead, or corrupted data. Some approaches I’ve considered: * **Chunking:** Splitting data into smaller packets that stay below MTU. * **Jumbo frames:** Using larger Ethernet frames if the network/hardware supports it. * **Application-level reassembly:** Handling sequencing and reconstruction myself. The challenge I’m seeing: When I use chunking, I sometimes get **unexpected/random values in the payload** when sending between PC ↔ MCU. I expected identical data (for validation), but occasionally I see corruption/mismatches. My questions: * Is chunking generally the best practice when using lwIP on MCUs, or could I be mishandling buffering/synchronization? * Are jumbo frames worth considering, or is it better to always stick with MTU-sized packets? * How do you usually handle reliability and validation when fragments/packets don’t match? I’d really appreciate advice from anyone who has tackled UDP fragmentation on embedded systems, especially with lwIP.", "label": "complex"}

{"text": "RTC clock in deep sleep\n\nHi guys, I hope this is the right place to ask this. I have built a project around an e paper board which needs to display the current time, and due to size constrains, I want to add as little external components as possible. That's why I am currently using the internal RTC of the esp32. I am updating it via ntp wherever I have a wifi connection, but part of the project is that it might be without WiFi connection for a few days, in between which the esp32 has to go into deep sleep to conserve battery. The problem: RTC is pretty inaccurate during deep sleep, as talked about a lot online. Basically after a day of periodic deep sleep the time is often off by 5-10 minutes. Possible solution: Espressifs website ([https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp ... \\_time.html](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/latest/esp32/api-reference/system/system_time.html)) states that one can switch the rtc clock source during deep sleep to a \"Internal 8.5MHz oscillator, divided by 256\" to get much better accuracy. However, I am not able to change this precompiled (?) parameter while using the esp32 core for the arduino ide. 1. I have heard that the official espressif-idf can change this easily. But I do not want to rewrite all my code (which is quite long) and I am not sure how to get the epaper working there 2.

{"text": "what is the most efficient way to synchronize and stream data between Master and Slave with SPI ?\n\nHi ! I am currently struggling to implement proper communication vis SPI between 2 Microcontrollers. The problem is I am unable to properly time the starting of clock by the master. The process goes as follow 1. Stream 64 bytes of input for a math calculation from master 2. Slave once receives 64bytes, performs math calculation and sends back 51 bytes of data to master 3. This entire process has to repeat in 1 khz. I use HAL for programming my STM32 MCU. When ever a transmit or receive call is made in Master side, master begins generating clock regardless of wether the slave is ready to perform a response operation. This causes the communication collapse and bytes getting shifted. Is there efficient way to synchronize this communication ? &amp;#x200B; I use MOSI,MISO and SCK.

But now the real question is which protocol makes the most sense. Here’s what I’ve looked into so far: * **ESP Mesh with Arduino IDE** → I found an [article on Circuit Digest](https://circuitdigest.com/microcontroller-projects/how-to-configure-an-esp-mesh-network-using-arduino-ide-to-communicate-between-esp32-esp8266-and-nodemcu) where they use a library for this. Has anyone here actually tried it? How reliable is it? * [**ESP BLE Mesh**](https://www.espressif.com/en/products/sdks/esp-idf/esp-ble-mesh) → Seems solid but I can’t find much Arduino support for it. Plus it means dropping ESP8266, so I’d need a good reason to go down this path. * [**ESP-Mesh Lite**](https://www.espressif.com/en/sdks/esp-mesh-lite) → Looks interesting, but again, not sure about Arduino compatibility. * **Zigbee or Matter** → Strong contenders, but this also rules out ESP8266.

I know that the RPi runs on 3.3V logic and the Nano runs on 5V logic, so it is not recommended to directly connect the two, so I have been using a bidirectional level shifter to communicate between the two.

However, when I connect the same pins without the level shifter (again, not reccommended, but in many tutorials) I instead get the expected message: avrdude: AVR device initialized and ready to accept instructions Reading | ################################################## | 100% 0.00s avrdude: Device signature = 0x1e950f (probably m328p) avrdude: safemode: hfuse reads as DA avrdude: safemode: efuse reads as F8 avrdude: safemode: hfuse reads as DA avrdude: safemode: efuse reads as F8 avrdude: safemode: Fuses OK (E:F8, H:DA, L:FF) avrdude done.

Some time ago, I decided to start building this massive mistake, and like all mistakes, it still remains unsolved to this day. So, to begin, this is a 4A charger where I digitally set the current to a less hot 2.5A. This specific charger requires a 25mΩ sense resistor at the output. So far so good. I also wanted to check the battery percentage and state, so I decided to go the Fuel Gauge route. Alongside the charger, there is one Buck @ 12A, one Boost @ 2A, and 2 LDOs for the local ESP32. Every rail then gets the output voltage set using a DigiPot. This is where the mistake took place: the case of the finished thing is credit card–sized with a height of just 1.2 cm, so space is not something I can give away for free. Efficiency is also important since it’s a battery-powered powerhouse. Everything works (strangely well), apart from the Fuel Gauge. I decided not to put in a separate sense resistor, but instead to share one with the charger. The problem is that the Fuel Gauge reports amazingly clean data half the time. The other half (mostly when the charger is working) it reports all registers as 0, apart from the temperature, which reports 273°C—something that is clearly not possible. I’ve looked at the I2C data, and it is clean. I even lowered the I2C speed in hopes of fixing the issue, but nope, no data for you.

{"text": "Store program settings and configuration into the MCU internal flash\n\nI have a bunch of settings that are stored into the MCU internal flash memory. Those settings usually go at the very last space inside the flash memory. The minimum size that I can perform flash erase is one sector which is 8 pages. That is 4096 Bytes (512Bytes per page). Currently I use all the sector, not because I have a lot of data but because the settings are scattered into 8 pages. Whenever I need to update a value into the flash, I read everything back into a huge array of 4K, edit the array and store it back. With that way I ensure the other values are not affected, because erase command deletes the whole sector. I need to optimize this. Every value is in the RAM already. I thought there's no need to copy the whole sector into a huge array in order to change a byte. I can erase it all and just re-write everything back. This way saves RAM space but might couple some modules. For example, consider the following piece of code: flashErase(); wifiSettingsStoreIntoFlash(); MQTTSettingsStoreIntoFlash(); userPasswordStoreIntoFlash(); userGUIOptionsStoreIntoFlash(); Wherever `flashErase()` is called, we must link every other module in order to call their `storeIntoFlash` method. The current implementation is the opposize. Every module that wants to store data includes `internalFlashModule` that does the whole work. But it needs RAM. Any ideas on this?", "label": "complex"}

The data is initially logged in binary format to circular buffer in RAM to ensure maximum logging speed and minimize data size in memory (maximize history). This binary data must be transferred to the server (host) and saved into a binary file for decoding. The size of the circular buffer in RAM typically ranges from a few kB to a few hundred kB. I am seeking advice on the most suitable methods for transferring this data to a server, from where it could then be downloaded to a PC for decoding, processing, and analysis. Using the MQTT protocol, the data must be split into smaller chunks and encoded in HEX or BASE64 format. Are there other methods, such as direct binary data transfer, with the following characteristics? * Minimal RAM usage, as RAM is quite limited in most embedded systems (both stack and working buffers). Data should be sent in several smaller pieces so that smaller communication buffer can be used if there is a larger circular buffer in the project. * Minimal data overhead for transfer to the server (minimizing cost of data). * Avoidance of complex communication libraries that would require significant program memory or steep learning curve.

In summary, I have an ESP32 PCB which needs to drive a small servo. To meet standby battery life constraints, both the boost circuit for generating the 4.2V, and the servo itself are switched so they can be fully disabled/disconnected when they're not in use. The problem is when connecting the servo via the mosfet (low-side), the ESP has a brownout. I only have a multi meter to test with, but I can see voltage on the 3.3V rail dropping to ~2.7V briefly. Since my last post, I have: * Added 100uF capacitor to the input of the boost circuit * Added 2x 100uF capacitor to the output of the boost circuit * Increased the resistance of the gate resistor to 2.7k (from 470R) * Separated the GPIO pins to enable the boost and connect the servo, so I can delay the connection until the boost circuit has had time to stabilize My test code is essentially: * Set power enable pin high * Wait 2000ms * Set servo enable pin high (connecting to circuit) * Wait 2000ms * Move servo Unfortunately after assembling and testing the latest PCB this still does not work, and crashes immediately after setting servo enable pin high. I tried to measure the inrush current of the servo using my bench power supply, which peaks at ~12mA when servo is first connected, but the screen doesn't update very fast so I doubt it's accuracy. * [Layout]", "label": "complex"}

{"text": "How to handle multiple I2C devices on ESP32 (FreeRTOS)?\n\nHi, I’m working on an project with ESP32 + FreeRTOS and multiple devices on the same I2C bus (RFID, IMU, IO Expander). 1. At first I used the **blocking APIs**. Everything worked fine — I managed all 3 devices inside a single task, processing one after another. But it was slow, and I don’t want to stick with blocking anymore. 2. Then I switched to **asynchronous mode** by setting `trans_queue_depth &gt; 0`, so ESP-IDF creates an internal queue. Now `read`/`write` calls return immediately, and when the transfer is done my registered callback gets called. The problem: in some cases (e.g., reading the IO Expander input register), I need the data **right away** to continue processing, but now I have to wait until the async transaction finishes in the background. So my question is: 👉 If you’ve faced this situation before (multiple I2C devices on one bus, needing both async performance and sometimes immediate data), how did you solve it? 👉 If you have several devices on the same bus like I do, would you create a separate task for each device, or manage them all under one “I2C manager task,” or use another Thanks", "label": "complex"}

{"text": "how to implement this buffer in fpga ?\n\nHello everyone, I'm developing a 16-channel logic analyzer on an Artix-7 35T FPGA and I'm facing a resource utilization issue with my buffer design. Project Overview 16 input channels, with data captured and compressed for each one. 32 Block RAMs (BRAMs) are used as a shared buffer pool to store the compressed data before transferring it to a PC. The user can select any combination of the 16 channels for a capture session. Current Architecture and Problem To write the compressed data into the BRAMs, I've implemented a round-robin arbiter. This arbiter selects an active channel and then routes its data to an available BRAM. While this approach is functionally correct, it has created a massive multiplexer structure to handle the connections from any of the 16 channels to any of the 32 BRAMs. This has resulted in extremely high resource usage, consuming nearly all of the Look-Up Tables (LUTs) on the FPGA. My synthesis report confirms that the tool is creating a large bank of 16-to-1 multiplexers for each BRAM's input port (32-bit data, 10-bit address, and write enable). Request for Help I'm looking for advice on a more resource-efficient buffering architecture. How can I effectively manage writing data from 16 different sources into a shared pool of 32 BRAMs without creating such a large combinatorial logic path? Any suggestions for alternative designs would be greatly appreciated.", "label": "complex"}

I found systems with a EtherCAT Master as a application on the pc and the slaves are Arduino EasyCAT shields or an ESP32 with a WIZ850iO Header as master and the same Arduino shields on the slaves. We are on a small budget and hardware from companies like Beckhoff are way over. Questions i got so far: 1. EtherCAT is a line topology but is it necessary to take a ethernet line from the last slave back to the master or would that be irrelevant. 2.

I tried switching to a dc motor and am coming into a few issues. What im trying to do is make it so when i press one on the remote, the motor will turn on and rotate at a slow rate for at least four hours, for the project i have in mind. And when i press the power button the motor turns off. I used code from lessons about the DC motor and the ir remote examples from the provided library, and modified them to work for my purposes. I currently have it working so when i press one the motor turns on for just a tenth of a second and then stops for a minute. And it just loops that until it receives a signal, being from the press of the power button. and each time it loops, it prints out the count of loops. I have a 9v battery plugged into the power module and the elegoo board is connected via usb to my computer. The issue im most concerned about is that the loop only seems to work for 7 minutes, and then, for whatever reason it stops. What’s interesting is that it is still able to receive a signal, so if its stopped and i press one on the remote it continues on. And what ive notice when i press the button after its stopped unintentionally, it resumes the count of the loops. Why does it stop looping after 7 minutes? I want this to be able to run for at least 4 hours unsupervised, is this attainable with the parts of hand? Could this be a problem with the power supply being only a 9v", "label": "complex"}

I am also not seeing high current draw from my power supply, and nothing in the board gets hot at all or smells funny. I also checked that all the 3.3V pins are connected together and to the 3.3V net. I also checked continuity between all ST-Link pins (SWO, SWDIO, SWCLK, 3.3V, GND, NRST). I also know this ST-Link works as I still use it to connect to other custom STM32 boards. Something weird I noticed is that on both VCAP pins I am getting 0.008V instead of the expected 1.2V.

{"text": "Analog multiplexer interference between adjacent channels\n\nI am using the circuit above to measure a variety of inputs, all of which are variable resistances. All 16 are connected, and all the resistances are on the order of 10k-100k. I am reading the values by switching channels on the multiplexer and reading the analog value at GP28. I notice that when I try to read all the values in succession, if the voltage at one input changes, it affects the voltage at adjacent inputs slightly. The effect is not huge but it is on the order of up to 3 bits in a 10-bit ADC read. Reading the channels in a non-adjacent order does not change this effect, but I find that introducing a delay between the channel switch and ADC read reduces it. At 5us the delay has no effect, but at 50us the interference is reduced to 1 bit. The datasheet for the CD74HC4067 gives a maximum propagation delay on switching of 95ns at 2v VCC, so the delay of 50us at 3v3 seems very long.

{"text": "DMA understanding\n\nHi,Wanted a better understanding of how the DMA does memory mapping as the tutorials from youtube and the ug didn't help as much as I wanted them to. Strangely, there is actually a post on this subreddit from a few years ago where someone asked the same question but I figured I had a different set of questions so why not open a new post. The only reason I wanted to use the DMA was to interact with a HLS ip that's taking in streams of data and outputting a stream. So the one thing they always do is enable the HP port on the Zynq and connect this to the DMA via an interconnect usually.My first question is what's the necessity for the HP connection to the DMA and what port in the DMA would you typically connect the HP port to. My 2nd question arises from the fact that my problem is somewhat different from theirs. I have an ADC and a DAC for starters. The idea is to store the ADC data in the DDR via 1 DMA (s2mm port) then use an axi mm2s port to stream the input data to the HLS IP from the DDR. After that, store the output of my HLS IP into the DDR (s2mm port but on a 2nd DMA) then use the mm2s port of the DMA to transfer data to the DAC. Does what I say make sense and if so where does the HP port come into play here ? My last question is now on memory addresses I'd be writing to. Do I have to specify 2 different locations in the DDR to perform this write or is there no need to specify the addresses ?

For testing purposes, both the gate driver and the high-side are connected to the same 12V supply and the load is a simple 2k2 Ohm resistor. Unfortunately the output is not as expected - the circuit does not manage to pull the output high. Pulling low works fine though.

For completeness, [here's what happens on the low side](https://imgur.com/M3nUCDt). Everything is as expected, when activated the gate is driven with ~8V, which drives the output low.

I designed a PCB with an ESP32-C3-WROOM-02 module that communicates with another external device over UART; the external device expects 5v TTL so I need a level-shifter. I initially used circuit **1** as it's well documented, but for *whatever* reason (I'm at a loss but open to ideas / suggestions as to why\\[1\\]) the ESP32 has issues draining enough current to get to 0v specifically on `GPIO21` that I'm using as TX. To work around the ESP32's lack of draining ability, I tested circuit **2** by rewiring the board, and it seems like it works fine but requires the output of the ESP32 be inverted. Doable, but could be confusing if I need to debug it or connect it up to something else. Circuit **3** I *think* will do the inversion so I can just leave everything default on the ESP32, but I'm less confident about the design / resistor values since I haven't seen this exact layout anywhere. Is circuit **3** reasonable (okay to just use 10K resistors everywhere)? Any other suggestions for working around a lack of drainage on the ESP32 for sending 5v UART signals? \\[1\\] I tried making sure the pullup was disabled and it was set to open-drain. GPIO0 seems to work fine with the same config, so it seems to be something about GPIO21 in particular. Removing both pullup resistors gets me from 0.6v when low, to 0.2v when low, but not the 0v I'm expecting / see with other pins. GPIO21 works fine when I'm using the ESP32-", "label": "complex"}

{"text": "Unexpected Voltage Drop on Atmega328P-AU. Just completed my first PCB, and everything works except for an unexpected voltage drop on one of the GPIO pins. I have PIN 7 (called 'Sensor Activate Pin') set as an output pin. It switches HIGH to provide power to a sensor. The sensor only consumes 5 mAh of energy, so it's perfectly suitable to be powered through the GPIO pins. When testing on a breadboard and perf board, everything works fine. However, on the PCB, the GPIO pin that's supposed to be powering the sensor is only providing 0.850v, despite having 5V supplied to VCC. This causes issues because my sensor needs at least 3v.I'm a little lost as to why this is happening. I would expect that nearly 5V should be coming from the GPIO pin and not 0.850v.", "label": "complex"}

I’ve been researching as much as I can, but I’d appreciate any guidance from those with more experience. I’m working on a project that involves capturing audio from more than four digital MEMS microphones at the same time and sending those signals to a Raspberry Pi 4 for processing. I started looking into ESP32-based solutions because of their built-in I²S support and flexibility. From what I’ve learned, the ESP32 has two I²S peripherals, and each can handle stereo input—so up to four channels total. That’s great, but I need to go beyond that. I’m wondering if there’s any ESP32-based board or module that can support more than four digital microphones, either through I²S or using PDM microphones instead. The goal is to capture all mic signals simultaneously and stream them to the Raspberry Pi with as little latency as possible. USB would be ideal for this, but other interfaces could work if they maintain sync and throughput. If anyone knows of existing boards, projects, or workarounds that go in this direction, I’d really appreciate the help. Thanks!", "label": "complex"}

{"text": "Communication protocols to run on ethernet in embedded context?\n\nHi, I am part of a hobbyist team using a FreeRTOS stack + CAN2.0 to send small amounts of data quickly and repeatedly with acceptable loss between 4 or 5 microcontrollers. The simplicity as of yet works well, and data we send is pretty quickly received. However, we want to involve cameras, high data rate sensors, and more into our system so we are going to try out 10Base-T1S ethernet. We have planned out most of the threadx/netx framework and the MAC layer stuff. What we are stumped on is how to message between microcontrollers in a fashion effectively as quick and simple-ish as CAN. We have thought of things like MQTT, but we believe the latency is much higher than CAN. Does anybody have experience with existing protocols on top of IP or on top of UDP, etc. (or a replacement of IP) that have low latency and perhaps some existing message labeling capabilities (to replace the concept of a CAN ID). Or, should we be just making our own system of encoding and labeling on top of say UDP?", "label": "complex"}

As a first step, I’m trying to establish a simple UART communication between my STM32F446RE Nucleo board and my laptop using RealTerm. I’m using PA2 (TX) and PA3 (RX) for testing, connected directly through the onboard ST-Link virtual COM port — so no external hardware. The issue: When I send anything from the STM, it appears corrupted in RealTerm. Both sides are set to the same baud rate, and the settings are 8N1. Here’s my code: ==================== #include \"main.h\" UART_HandleTypeDef huart1; UART_HandleTypeDef huart2; void SystemClock_Config(void); static void MX_GPIO_Init(void); static void MX_USART1_UART_Init(void); static void MX_USART2_UART_Init(void); /* Private user code ---------------------------------------------------------*/ uint8_t Data[15] = \"Hello STM\\r\\n\"; int main(void) { HAL_Init(); SystemClock_Config(); MX_GPIO_Init(); MX_USART1_UART_Init(); MX_USART2_UART_Init(); while (1) { HAL_UART_Transmit_IT(&amp;huart2, Data, 12); HAL_Delay(2000); } } void HAL_UART_TxCpltCallback(UART_HandleTypeDef *huart) { if (huart-&gt;Instance == USART2) { HAL_GPIO_TogglePin(GPIOA, GPIO_PIN_5); // Toggle LED on TX complete } } ==================== All the other functions were auto-generated by STM32CubeMX. Question: Why does RealTerm show corrupted data when receiving from the STM32 with the same baud rate and settings ? What could be causing this?", "label": "complex"}
{"text": "What do you guy's think about pulling the SDI connections before starting the camera?\n\nIn general I think it's common sense, that you power first and then connect video. I know this also adapts to Teradeks and monitors. But does it actually make a difference? On monitors I mostly ignore the rule, but on cameras, especially Alexas I am kinda concerned and just want to be sure, so anytime I power the camera back on I disconnect the video signal. But is this actually important? A DP I often work with always says that people at Arri told him to do this and since he owns an Mini LF he is very careful and does that too. I kinda adapted that from him. I know theoretically, especially with 12G ports you could fry either the monitor or the camera, but it never happend to me on my own camera nor have I ever heard about someone, who witnessed this.

{"text": "MEMS mic noise reduction\n\nHi all, I have been testing few mems mic (INMP441 default) to record environment sound with ESP32. I have fixed basic issues with reading and transferring data and am able to record sound. The issue is the sound tends to have a humming component. Now this could be for a couple of reasons that I can think of 1. The 3.3 v of esp32 is not stable enough. 2. Mic being very sensitive to environment wind or any noise. Note: I am not very familiar with physical filters. I tried using a low pass RC filter on the 3.3 v power line to supply current to the mic, but it filtered out all the current and nothing worked. Then I tried a low pass filter at 160 Hz and the mix worked but the issue persisted. I would much rather capture the raw data at esp32 end and do post processing. Normalizing at -3 dB helps to amplify the sound slightly but also amplifies the noise. My objective is to lower the humming sound here and get better environment sound data.

I want to send capital letter \"A\" from one to another, and I programmed the receiver to light the LED(LED of nucleo board) when it takes the desired data. However, it didn't work, so i used a logic analyzer to see what was happening in the transmission, and when i attached the analyzer i took framing error which is 0xFF, i searched for it in web and i used two different AI modules, but in the end i could not solve my problem. I am able to make a basic UART communication between my PC and a stm32 board by using ST-link, but i cannot achieve to build a communication between a stm32 and a raspberry pi 4b by using the pins of raspi, so i think, i could not set the idea precisely (idea of build serial communication by pins or the things like that) into my mind. Like as I said in the beginning, I am new student in a university, so i do not know deeply, I am trying to go through it by reading documents or using AI.

What I have here is Arduino nano connected to beat detector that takes its input from Microphone, some 16 meters (50+ foot) or RGB LED strips glued to my ceiling and IR remote to control things. Here is [video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rwH7J50j5_g). General idea behind beat detection is that I have electret mic, some amp then low pass filter with steep attenuation (can be build from double op-amp chip, some caps and resistors). From low pass filter signal goes to comparator (op-amp can be used). And then there is single transistor to drive red LED on panel and provide input to arduino. To drive led strips I use MOSFETs, they are cooled to aluminium case - transistors get really hot. Transistors can handle about 1500 Watts at 12 Volts but I think my case would not be able dissipate heat quickly enough so I may be limited to 500-1000 watts. I am currently using up to 180 watts under max load, case just gets barely warm. For now I have connected IR module that was removed from \"stock\" LED strip controller that you get together with strips. I am also planning to connect external xeon strobe to flash from time to time (if you watch the video you can see strobe lamp next to controller and power supply).

{"text": "I've just released an MIT-licensed library that allows you to use Open Telemetry to help understand what your code is doing without attaching a serial cable!\n\nI keep building things using ESP32-based devices, but I was getting frustrated that the only way to find out if something had gone wrong was because the expected output didn't do what I wanted. I didn't want to have to connect a laptop and serial cable every time I needed to see the logs, so I wrote this library to find out what's going on and analyse it in more detail! You can get the library at [https://github.com/proffalken/otel-embedded-cpp](https://github.com/proffalken/otel-embedded-cpp), and it allows you to export metrics, logs, and traces from your embedded code to your existing Observability stack (I use Grafana Cloud) so you can see what's going on alongside the rest of your applications. The images below are from a very basic micro-ROS based robot, but hopefully you can already see the power of this library! Issues, pull-requests, and comments are all welcome - I'd love to hear your thoughts!
