{"text": "How to avoid interference on longer data runs?\n\nWorking on a project with three LED strips controlled from an ESP32. They're horizontal on the wall of a theater, and the ESP32 and other components are at ground level. The top strip has a data line about 6 ft long. This seems to be causing some issues and it flickers and consistently has the incorrect colors as compared to the other strips. Swapping strips didn't help, so I've rules out a bad strip, and I've redone all of the power lines with injection at the end of the strips as well. Only the top strip has this issue. At this point, I am fairly confident that it's an interference issue...What are my best options for reducing interference on this line?", "label": "complex"}

Im trying to make a simple version of a hall effect keyboard (similar to the [wooting](https://wooting.io/)) as my final project and i have a few questions: 1. I am using a Blackpill (STM32F411CEU6) alongside a multiplexer (74HC4067) and hall effect sensor (SS49E) and when i connect them using a breadboard, the value coming from the sensors tend to wobble a lot (+-60) even though i have tried using 0.1uF capacitor for each sensor. (Connecting the VCC and GND pin). Is this normal behaviours for using a breadboard and if so is there any way i can improve the signal, I want to priotize hardware solution first before using software filters. 2.

Covered these types of events for the the past 25 years and this is the first time I've come across this audio problem (and with a piece of gear that is supposedly much less likely to distort). Here are the details. If anyone can explain why this was happening, I'd be grateful. This WAV file excerpt was recorded via direct input to a Zoom F3 from a QSC KW122 powered PA at an event (loop-through output via XLR cable), and run into a barrel XLR attenuator set to -40dB. Levels can't be 'set' on the Zoom F3, but the waveform was quite normal during the recording at a visual x4 zoom setting, no obvious spikes. Music and mic were very loud...but not distorted when I was listening without my foam earplugs. The spectrogram shows a massive difference between the two levels, at least 30dB Sample clip: [https://soundcloud.com/user-725122131/distorted-32-bit-float](https://soundcloud.com/user-725122131/distorted-32-bit-float) I've had the Zoom F3 for a few months now, and this is the first time it's distorted any part of the audio. I can understand that the inputs can be overloaded, but with a -40dB in-line attenuation and 32 bit float, I figured that I was more than safe. I've done loop-through outputs from identical systems in the past without this problem. Like I said, to the audience's ear, the MC's mic did not sound distorted, and the levels were pretty well matched to the music levels (to the point that it was sometimes hard to hear the an", "label": "complex"}

{"text": "EEPROM write timing and data loss during power-off in low-cost microcontrollers\n\nHi everyone, I’m investigating an interesting EEPROM write behavior in a low-cost consumer device that measures temperature (simple microcontroller-based design, probably Holtek or Padauk class). In one specific test, I noticed that a newly measured value wasn’t saved to EEPROM, and the device showed the previously stored value on the next power-up. To understand this better, I did about 40–50 tests and found the following pattern: • Normally, the device writes intermediate measurement values to EEPROM before the final “beep” or confirmation. • If the measurement is aborted early, it still usually saves the latest stable value. • In one rare case, it didn’t write the new value, even though the temperature was stable for several seconds — only the old EEPROM value remained. • If I slightly touch or move the battery, the memory resets completely, showing a “LOC” code. This suggests a very simple architecture: • RAM holds the live reading, • EEPROM commit happens periodically or after a stability threshold, • and power/voltage fluctuations may interrupt the write process. ⸻ ❓My question: From a firmware/embedded design perspective, what are typical strategies in ultra-low-cost MCUs to handle EEPROM writes safely when power might drop suddenly? Specifically: • Are EEPROM commits usually buffered, interrupted, or atomic? • Is it common to perform EEPROM writes periodically during measurement (not only after an event)? • Could a short button hold or battery voltage dip realisticall", "label": "complex"}

{"text": "Battery monitoring on ESP32-S3 Super Mini dev board\n\nHey everyone! I'm working on an e-paper calendar + weather + news project using an ESP32-S3 SuperMini board with a WeAct 4.2'' e-paper display. It updates every 10 minutes and uses deep sleep for power efficiency. The board has an integrated LTH7R charging IC for the Li-Po battery. My main challenge is that there is not Datasheet available for the dev board (Bought on AliExpress) and I would like to monitor the battery. The LTH7R itself won't provide battery voltage monitoring functionality (only for stopping charging) as per its datasheet. The board has multiple ADC-capable pins, and I'm wondering if there might be an internal voltage divider already connected to one of them (common in some ESP32 boards). AI recommended me to write a simple program to scan the ADC pins while connected to a fully charged battery (4.2V) to see if any reads approximately half the battery voltage, indicating an internal divider. Does that make sense? Or would it be better to build a voltage divider and connect it to an ADC pin? Would you recommend me to use a Charging module (TP4056) to add extra protection and faster battery charging? I'm planning on using a large LiPo (4500mah) (not the 18650 in the picture). https://preview.redd.it/sxepwmwwj6ce1.jpg?width=1600&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6f4e359a9eb86e16f4cc6a48b56beb8c97c5c2f5 https://preview.redd.it/9meaa2xwj6ce1.jpg?width=1920&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=866e566f47e9901c3dc67bd70f0d1ad4cbb81d63", "label": "complex"}

Is it possible to connect two or more AHT21 sensors in series using the Qwiic connectors on the sensor boards? 2. Can the I2C address of the AHT21 sensors be changed or configured to avoid conflicts? 3. If not, is the Qwiic connector mainly meant to chain sensors with different I2C addresses? 4. Or do I necessarily need to use an I2C multiplexer to handle multiple identical sensors on the same bus? Any advice or experience on this would be really helpful!
